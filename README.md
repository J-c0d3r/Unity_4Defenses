# Unity_4Defenses

It's a Top Down Shooter game style. I wished to develop a complete game only by me and I made this game by this way.
The idea of this game is you need to protect your base from monsters that come to destroy it or you. So you need to kill them and keep alive yourself. You have some weapons and defends.

<strong>Purpose:</strong> Develop a whole game by me and get more experience in 2D game style. It'll be better than previous game(JetFire) which I developed and it'll have more features such as multiplayer online, a little shop system, upgrade system and more, and that it might seem like a good complete 2D game with multiplayer.
